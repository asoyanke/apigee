# Apigee API Management | Google Cloud

## Why Apigee Load Balancer and Cloud Armor alone are not enough to protect API?

**GCP Load Balancers:** Distribute incoming traffic across multiple Vertex AI instances for scalability and availability. They provide basic network-level (Layer 3/4) security.

**Cloud Armor:** A Web Application Firewall (WAF) that protects against Layer 7 attacks like DDoS, SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS). It integrates with GCP Load Balancers.

**The Gaps: Why It's Not Enough**

- **API-Specific Threats**: Load Balancers and Cloud Armor are not specialized in understanding the nuances of API vulnerabilities.  Attackers can exploit the logic and structure of APIs (e.g., broken object-level authorization, mass assignment) that general network-level protection may miss.
- **Data/Model Security**: Vertex AI endpoints may expose sensitive data or models. Cloud Armor won't protect against:
  - Data exfiltration at the API level
  - Unauthorized access to model inference endpoints
  - Attacks on model integrity (model poisoning), models can be manipulated by sending incorrect or malicious data to the training data or learning process.
- **Business Logic Flaws**: Load Balancers and Cloud Armor don't understand your application's business logic. Attackers might manipulate API calls in ways that seem legitimate but abuse the underlying business processes.
